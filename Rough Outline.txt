Front-End
	* Need button options to decide if starting new group or joining existing one
		* Creating -- Generate group code, ask for ZIP
			* Send ZIP code and group code to Database for linking and processing
		* Joining -- Ask for group code, reject if invalid, link with host if valid
	* When everyone has joined, host can "start the voting"
	* Waits until everyone has finshed voting to display the "winner"

Google Maps API
	* Project Name VandyHacks. (id = 'vandyhacks-2020') API key = 'AIzaSyALcnLOO6jrbkQD5JL7tlMjFfb4EmC4W24'
	* Documentation for place search found at https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search
	* Need list of nearest (Best?) resturants to ZIP Code
	* Get Names, ratings? Pictures?
	* Send 20(?) or fewer resturants to back-end for processing

Database
	* Store group code in database, store for ~20 min, use database to validify group codes
	  sent by joining users
	* Store ZIP of host user, to be sent and used by the group once voting starts
	* Deletes both codes after some time (20-30 mins?) has passed since starting the vote,
	  allowing that group code to be generated and used for new groups.

Info Processing
	* Compares rankings between each person
		* Each person gets an object, each object will have a "ranking list" of some sort
		* Update "ranking list" based on results of front-end voting
	* Decide highest average rating? Highest total rating, basically
	* Send "winning" resturant back to front-end to display
